Godot Shaders is a repository of Free shaders, part of which we made for our course [Godot Shader Secrets](https://gdquest.mavenseed.com/courses/shader-secrets-learn-to-code-2d-and-3d-shaders-in-godot).

## The shaders

Here's a list of available shaders:

- X-Ray 2D
- Distortion (shockwave)
- Inverted colors
- Pointilism
- Outline2D
- Outline3D
- 7 color stencil mask simulation (impossible cube)
- 2D glow
- 2D baked-in-texture glow control
- Dissolve 2D
- Dissolve 3D
- Blur

## How to use

You can find the shaders in the `Shaders/` directory. Most shaders come with a demo scene. All demos are in the `Demos/` directory.

The `Intro/` directory contains an intro animation to the shader pipeline, that we use in our shader course.
